# autonomous_traffic_simulation

This software will simulate the flow of autonomous cars through intersecting
city streets. The cars will be limited in their capacity to sense and
communicate with the cars around them because of the security risk involved
with wireless connections. The purpose of this simulation is to determine
information about the average time for limited autonomous cars to move
through a city, to help figure out a city plan for such cars. The user will
be able to input the number of north-south two-way streets (which equals the
number of east-west two-way streets) in the city grid, the number of cars
that can fit in a single segment, the speed of each car, the entry and exit
points of each car in the simulation, and the probability of a new car
entering the simulation in a given unit of time.
